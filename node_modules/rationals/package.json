This is what\nrational numbers do best. Operations like `0.1 + 0.2` are a pain in js,\nbut using rational numbers, it's just: `r(1,10).plus(1,5) === r(3,10)`\n\n- This lib provides a type of object which will work with 1/0 or 0/0 just as well.\nThis is especially useful if you plan to plot values on a graph.\n\nI've got the inspiration for this lib from here: [MF105: The extended rational numbers in practice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQkLojL2ek)\n\n# Support\n[![browser support](https://ci.testling.com/ashnur/rationals.png)](https://ci.testling.com/ashnur/rationals)\n\n\n\n\n# Examples\n```\nvar r = require('rationals');\n\nr(1) === r(1); // true, denominator of 1 is optional\n\nr(1,1) === r(1); // true\n\nr(2,4) === r(13,26); // true, all rationals will be always reduced\n\nr(100,50) === r(2); // true\n\nr(1,2).plus(r(1,3)).minus(r(1,4)).times(r(1,5)).per(r(1,6)) === r(49,70); // true, chaining works\n\nr(355,113).val(); // 3.1415929203539825, my personal favorite aproximation of Pi, from ancient china\n\n\n```\n\n# API\n- _a & b are objects created with the rationals() function_\n( I deleted the internal checks for this, so you should make sure to construct the numbers yourself)\n- in the parentheses you have some common aliases for the functions\n\n\n#### Addition\n- add (plus)\n\n    `a.add(b)`\n\n#### Subtraction\n- subtract (minus, sub)\n\n    `a.sub(b)`\n\n#### Multiplication\n- multiply (times, mul)\n\n    `a.mul(b)`\n\n#### Division\n- divide (per, div)\n\n    `a.div(b)`\n\n#### Examining\n- toString\n\n    Examining an object can be hard, but if you cast it to a string: `r(355,113)+''` will return `'355/113'`.\n\n    So will `r(625/125).toString()` return `'5/1'`.\n\n#### Display\n- display\n\n    Just like toString(), but the numerator will be shown only if it's not 1. That is, integers will appear without a slash and a denominator.\n\n    `r(625/125).display()` returns `'5'`.\n\n#### Approximation\n- val\n\n    Will return the numerator divided with the denominator.\n\n    `r(355,113).val(); //3.1415929203539825`\n\n# Good to know\nIf you provide anything else as the numerator, than a whole number in base 10 an exception will be thrown.\nOn the other hand, if you do the same with the denominator, it will be cast to 1. This is because\nI am lazy, and I do not want to handle wrong values and undefined values differently throwing for the former\nand casting to 1 for the latter.\n\n# Install\n```\nnpm install rationals\n```\n\n**You can use it in the browser with [browserify](http://browserify.org/)**\n",
